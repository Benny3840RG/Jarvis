# Jarvis TypeScript Roadmap

This file is a living record for the autonomous engineering sessions working on
Jarvis: current state, what changed recently, and what to pick up next. Update
it at the end of every session.

## Recovery engineering update (2026-09-11)

The bounded recovery candidate now captures existing S4 evidence and mutable-quote
inventories and proves the supported closed subset through ordinary stores. Its
joint primitive uses one Convex transaction, exact shared rows, typed identities,
and actual JSON business digests. It remains partial and unregistered for restore.
The archive payload/marker coordinator, remaining effect/history domains, blobs
and real provider recovery drills are still engineering work; external account
gates do not make these local gaps complete. See
`docs/architecture/backup-v4-s4-restore-slice.md` for exact support and limits.

## PR handover work (2026-09-10)

- Added trusted automatic advisory PR review with isolated reviewer/publication
  jobs and exact head/base/CI evidence binding. Same-repository PRs receive review;
  only authentic approved builder candidates receive automatic repair authority.
- Extended the existing builder with two-attempt, same-PR repairs. Cumulative
  forbidden-path/content guards, trusted controls, owner merge and queue locking
  remain enforced. Candidate verification now authenticates every required producer.
- Hardened post-merge GitHub evidence and merged-head reconciliation. Missing or
  neutral/skipped checks, wrong producers and different reviewed heads fail closed.
- Added a development-only executable post-merge completion command that loads
  existing durable bindings before using the established Omega gateway.
- Local validation is recorded in the Phase 1 working ledger. Live activation is
  pending this control-plane PR landing and the drill in
  `docs/operations/pr-maintenance.md`; no live completion is inferred here.
- Added durable Actions admission, isolated worker-lease supervision, head-bound
  verification/review checkpoints, owner ToolAction proposal and post-merge
  completion scheduling. Issue acceptance criteria stay unverified until real
  independent evidence is recorded through the existing Omega authority.
- Next: deploy the bridge to the authorised development runtime, configure its
  credentials/explicit uncertainty decisions, and run an owner-approved live
  issue through the full handover. Local tests do not close commissioning.

## Current state (2026-09-08)

- `npm run check` (hygiene + `tsc` + ESLint + Prettier + OpenAPI lint + Node
  tests + Convex/vitest tests) passes cleanly: 1174 Node tests, 0 failures.
- The codebase is mature and broad: a maintained TypeScript CLI plus HTTP and
  private ChatGPT/MCP adapters, a Totality reasoning/approval system, and a
  full trade-business domain layer (clients, quotes, invoices, projects,
  properties, enquiries, errands, assets, builds, upgrades, business
  settings, preferences) each with parallel JSON and Convex-backed stores.
- No `TODO`/`FIXME` markers exist in `src/`.
- There is a separate, tightly-controlled autobuild/queue automation system
  (`.github/workflows/jarvis-autobuild.yml` and friends) with its own bounded
  worker, draft-PR-only publication, and exact-candidate verification. Issues
  scoped to that control plane (currently #462, #472, #473) are written for
  that dedicated worker, not for a general autonomous session — leave those
  alone unless explicitly asked to pick one up.
- Several open GitHub issues (#293, #294, #297, #302, #303, #306, #307, #324)
  are external commissioning gates (Outlook OAuth, Sentry, PostHog, a real
  OIDC provider, production deployment approval). These need operator-supplied
  credentials/decisions and are not actionable by an autonomous coding session.

## Production reconciliation (2026-09-11)

Base: `fae9949fc1f9d1ce15729608384a6d32ec40b8cb` (PR #501).

- Archive v4 captures core, memory, business records and settings. The isolated
  restore verifier reads ordinary stores and verifies references and digests.
  The old S1-only/S2-next status is superseded by merged #492 and #501.
- Complete recovery remains unavailable: notes/evidence, durable orchestration,
  quote aggregates/delivery history and artifact recovery still need capture,
  domain-aware restoration and read-back proof. Group presence alone is not proof.
- Development Live Work is being completed on the existing Convex/HTTP/MCP path.
  Idle, unavailable and ambiguous selection are distinct; ΩΣ readiness cannot
  commit COMPLETE. Current ΩΣ storage does not persist residual uncertainty,
  so the read-only query honestly reports that missing readiness input.
- Current evidence and remaining commissioning gates are recorded in
  [the production ledger](../../docs/operations/production-completion-ledger.md).

## This session's work

**Development specification validation.** Empty or whitespace-only GitHub issue
titles are now rejected with the machine-readable `TITLE_EMPTY` reason, while
surrounding whitespace on valid titles remains normalized before hashing.

**Backup/restore coverage gap (priority area 7).** `npm run backup` only ever
covered `state`/`tasks`/`reminders` (`src/backup/backup.ts`), even though the
app has grown 13 more JSON-backed domains living in their own files under
`data/` (`jarvis-clients.json`, `jarvis-quotes.json`, `jarvis-invoices.json`,
`jarvis-projects.json`, `jarvis-properties.json`, `jarvis-enquiries.json`,
`jarvis-errands.json`, `jarvis-assets.json`, `jarvis-builds.json`,
`jarvis-build-logs.json`, `jarvis-upgrades.json`,
`jarvis-business-settings.json`, `jarvis-preferences.json`). A disaster or a
bad restore would have silently dropped almost all real business data.

Fixed in this session, backup archive version bumped 2 -> 3:

- `builds`, `buildLogs`, `upgrades`, `assets`, and `preferences` — the exact
  five-domain "memory store" bundle `npm run import:convex` already treats as
  one unit (`src/importer/importMemoryStores.ts`) — are now included in
  export/verify/restore. `runBackup.ts` wires provider-aware (JSON or Convex,
  per `PERSISTENCE_PROVIDER`) stores for all five.
- `buildLogs.buildId` and `upgrades.buildId` reference `builds.id`. Restore
  regenerates build ids (stores don't accept a caller-supplied id) and remaps
  those references through an old-id -> new-id map, verified by a
  content-signature check (`assertRestoredMemoryStores` in `backup.ts`).
- Fixed a related, confirmed bug in `importMemoryStores.ts`: it copied
  `buildId` verbatim from source to target without remapping, so a real
  `npm run import:convex` run would silently orphan every build log/upgrade
  (the existing test's `buildId: "b-1"` literal never matched a real created
  build's id, which is how this went uncaught). Now fixed with the same
  remap approach, plus a regression test and a fail-closed check for a
  build log/upgrade referencing an unknown build id.
- Legacy v1/v2 archives still parse fine (the five new fields default to
  empty); restoring one doesn't require supplying memory stores. Restoring a
  v3 archive that _does_ contain memory-domain records without supplying
  memory stores is refused rather than silently dropping that data.
- 17 tests in `tests/backup.test.ts` (up from 10), including a real
  JSON-file end-to-end round trip, a non-empty-target refusal per domain, and
  malformed-record rejection. `tests/importMemoryStores.test.ts` covers the
  buildId-remap fix.

**Known limitation, documented in code and README:** unlike the atomic
state/tasks/reminders restore, restoring the five memory domains is NOT
atomic — it's one `add()` call per record (same limitation
`importMemoryStores.ts` already had). A failure partway through a large
memory-domain restore can leave a partial set of records. This is
acceptable for now (up-front emptiness checks mean the only way to fail
partway through is a genuine store error, not a refused precondition) but
worth revisiting if backup restore becomes a routine disaster-recovery path
rather than an occasional operator action.

## Next steps

1. **Complete remaining archive v4 domains.** Core/memory and cross-referenced
   business records are implemented in v4. Next are notes/evidence and durable
   orchestration, including replay identities and reference validation. Preserve
   logical IDs in an empty destination; translate platform IDs with typed,
   table-scoped maps. Follow [the v4 contract](architecture/backup-v4-contract.md).
2. **Quote delivery / PDF artifact backup.** The delivery-attempt/outcome ledger
   is authoritative history, including failed and indeterminate outcomes;
   re-sending cannot restore it. PDF bytes are only conditionally regenerable
   from the full aggregate/revision snapshot, stored issuer/client/generatedAt
   and pinned renderer, with a verified digest. Blob backup remains in scope.
   See the [domain inventory](architecture/authoritative-domain-inventory.md)
   and [v4 contract](architecture/backup-v4-contract.md).
3. **`personalTraitsService.ts` dead code.** `addNote` and `priorityRank` on
   `PersonalTraitsService` (`src/runtime/personalTraitsService.ts`) are
   unused anywhere in the codebase or tests (only `dailyBrief`/`motivation`
   are wired into `cli.ts`). Low priority cleanup: delete them, or wire them
   up if they were meant to ship.
4. **Convex test coverage measurement.** `npm run test:coverage` only
   instruments `tests/*.test.ts` and `jarvis-console-01/tests/*.test.ts` via
   Node's built-in coverage; the parallel `convex/*.test.ts` suite (running
   under vitest via `npm run test:convex`) isn't included in that report, so
   the coverage numbers for Convex-adjacent modules
   (`convexQuoteDeliveries.ts`, etc.) understate real coverage. Not urgent,
   but worth combining the two reports if coverage numbers start driving
   decisions.

## Notes for future sessions

- Before touching `.github/workflows/jarvis-autobuild.yml` or its automation
  policy tests, check whether the task is actually meant for the dedicated
  autobuild worker (see "Current state" above) — those issues carry very
  specific scope boundaries and evidence requirements that assume a
  different execution model than a general session.
- `PERSISTENCE_PROVIDER` (`json` default, or `convex`) governs builds,
  buildLogs, upgrades, assets, preferences, and notes the same way it governs
  core state/tasks/reminders — see `selectMemoryStore` in `src/http/app.ts`
  for the canonical per-domain provider-selection pattern; `runBackup.ts`'s
  `createMemoryStoresFromEnv()` mirrors it for the CLI.
- Business settings (`src/businessSettings/`) has no Convex-backed store yet
  (`JsonBusinessSettingsStore` only) — flag this if `PERSISTENCE_PROVIDER=convex`
  commissioning ever depends on it.

- Repaired the post-merge #491 handover findings: exact completion bindings, trusted check selection, non-poisoning retry observations, issue-bound repair provenance, guarded failed checkpoints and independently observed unpublished-worker recovery.
- Added stable completion pagination and finalisation after both durable authorities complete; retained explicit owner reconciliation for published/uncertain dead workers and stale, closed or terminal merge candidates. See `docs/operations/issue-493-owner-handoff.md`.
- Next: owner-approved control landing with #496, exact development commissioning, then #493's real build/review and separately approved merge/post-merge acceptance proof. No live lifecycle completion is claimed from regression tests.
- Development admission now selects an issue-specific uncertainty-budget variable; approving one issue cannot supply a default budget to another. Residual uncertainty and owner merge gates remain separate.
- Live PR-maintenance failures led to bounded, digest-checked prompt-file transport and the isolated publisher permission required for PR comments; model execution remains read-only.
- Removed the redundant reviewer `--skip-git-repo-check` argument after the live #493 review proved that the pinned Codex action already supplies it.

## Development merge observation compatibility

- Pin only GitHub PR-detail reads to API 2022-11-28 because 2026-03-10 removed `merge_commit_sha`; preserve actual provider SHA checks for reconciliation and completion. Other requests retain their current API version.
- Issue #493 live proof exposed the mismatch after a succeeded governed merge. Preserve the inconclusive observation; retry only after a fresh provider observation includes the actual merge SHA.
- Remove the completion observer self-dependency using exact workflow/app/commit/branch/event provenance; retain all required CI and unrelated-failure gates, plus prior inconclusive proofs.

## S4 bounded capture primitive (2026-09-11)

- Added owner-scoped, one-transaction raw Convex capture for all 17 S4 tables,
  preserving complete source rows and tagged Convex values with lossless checks.
- This is capture material only: no `notesAndEvidence` archive coverage or
  restored verification is credited. See [the S4 capture boundary](architecture/backup-v4-s4-capture.md).
- Next: inert empty-target restore, typed references (including S5 links),
  ordinary-store read-back and source/restored digest proof before integration.

- S4 isolated restore increment: projects/notes-only typed adapter, exact capture
  integrity/inventory checks, fresh application-database refusal, atomic schema-backed
  insertion, typed source-ID metadata and ordinary-store/digest readback. All other
  nonempty S4 tables fail closed; verification returns partial with no verified group.
  Remaining S4 logical/physical/opaque references are classified in
  `architecture/backup-v4-s4-restore-slice.md`; project memory and effect-history
  inertness plus S5 bindings remain required before whole-group coverage.

- S4 terminal project-memory increment: same isolated adapter now supports the four
  existing memory-record kinds, applied/rejected change sets and their exact typed
  memory audit history. Ordinary grouped/service reads and tagged digests verify
  restoration; replay tests prove no new records, revisions or audit writes. Active
  proposals, arbitrary payloads and effect/worker histories remain unsupported;
  whole-group coverage remains partial with no verified group.
